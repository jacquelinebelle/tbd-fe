As a user you can search for jobs by Title, *(optionally specifying a city)*, along with their salary requirements and the max distance away from the location they're searching, and return recent job listings. If the User is  interested in the Job, they can see more details about that Job and the detailed data on the closest urban area with scores for general city score, detailed city scores, and salaries from the city in which they are applying.
